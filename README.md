# A sim to play the Digimon Trading Card Game
As of 12/12/2022, Bandai has not created a digital version of the Digimon Trading Card Game.
I am working on a simulator to play the game which will automate effects and a user friendly UI.
I am hoping to use this project as a means to introduce my friends to my favorite card game as well as a programming project to work on in my spare time.
